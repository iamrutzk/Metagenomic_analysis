# Metagenomic_analysis
Metagenomic analysis of the taxonomic composition and functional potential of microbial communities from different environmental samples.

#  Software Requirements:
* Operating System: Linux/Mac/Windows with WSL
* R (version 4.0+) with packages: phyloseq, vegan, ggplot2, dplyr
* Python (version 3.8+) with packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
* FastQC for quality control
* Trimmomatic for read trimming
* Kraken2 for taxonomic classification
* QIIME2 (optional but recommended)

# The metagenomic datasets from different environments:
1. Human gut microbiome (healthy vs. diseased)
2. Marine water samples (surface vs. deep water)
3. Soil samples (forest vs. agricultural)
